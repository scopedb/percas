Welcome to Percas!

To verify the deployment status, run:

  kubectl get pods -l app.kubernetes.io/name={{ include "percas.name" . }} -n {{ .Release.Namespace }}

To access the Percas service within your cluster:

  http://{{ include "percas.name" . }}.{{ .Release.Namespace}}.svc.{{ .Values.clusterDomain }}

{{- if contains "ClusterIP" .Values.service.type }}

The service is only accessible within the Kubernetes cluster. To access it from outside:

  kubectl port-forward svc/{{ include "percas.fullname" . }} {{ .Values.service.port }}:{{ .Values.service.port }} -n {{ .Release.Namespace }}
{{- else if contains "LoadBalancer" .Values.service.type }}

The service is exposed via LoadBalancer. Wait until an external IP is assigned:

  kubectl get svc {{ include "percas.fullname" . }} -n {{ .Release.Namespace }} -w
{{- end }}
