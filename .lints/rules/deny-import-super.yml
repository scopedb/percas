language: Rust
message: "discouraged import using `super` path"
note: |
   reason: using `super::` paths for imports can cause issues when moving or refactoring code between files or modules.
   help: prefer using `crate::` paths for imports, as this makes the code more robust to changes in module hierarchy and easier to refactor.
