# Percas

Percas is a persistent cache service.

## Getting Started

To get started with Percas, you can follow these steps:

1. Build the project: `cargo x build`
2. Start a local server: `./target/debug/percas --config-file dev/config.toml`

Now, you can put and get a key-value pair into the cache using the following command:

```shell
curl -X PUT -H 'Content-Type: application/json' http://localhost:7654/my_lovely_key -d 'my_lovely_value'
curl -X GET -H 'Content-Type: application/json' http://localhost:7654/my_lovely_key
```
